Experimental Background: Electrochemical reduction of 2-methyl-2-nitropropane (MeNP) at a mercury hemisphere electrode. The electrode kinetics was quasi-irreversible so the electrochemical reaction is described with Butler-Volmer (B-V) kinetics. The relatively small electrode radius at the micrometer scale suggests that the mass transport is dominated by radial diffusion. The electrochemical reaction is:

MeNP + e<sup>-</sup> <----> MeNP<sup>·-</sup>

The bulter-volmer equation is:

j = -k<sub>red</sub>c<sub>MeNP</sub> + k<sub>ox</sub>c<sub>MeNP<sup>·-</sup></sub>

 where j is the flux. k<sub>red</sub> and k<sub>ox</sub> are the electrochemical rate constants for reduction and oxidation reactions respectively. The two rate constants are correlated with B-V kinetics (see reference).
