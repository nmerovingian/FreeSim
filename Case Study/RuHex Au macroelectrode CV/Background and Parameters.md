Experimental Background: Reduction of [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> in aqueous KCl electrolyte solution on a Au macroelectrode. The large size of electrode suggests that the reaction is dominated by linear diffusion. The electrochemical reaction is:

[Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> <-----> [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>

These parameters are necessary for simulation
